* Tsvart: Mirja Kuhlewind

|I have two editorial comments and one request:
|
|1) I would really recommend including "IP" in the document title to be absolute
|clear about the scope. So renaming to "IP Fragmentation Avoidance in DNS".

Changed the title in -16 as proposed.

|2) This sentence is really hard to read:
|"TCP avoids fragmentation using its Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
|parameter, but each transmitted segment is header-size aware such
|that the size of the IP and TCP headers is known, as well as the far
|end's MSS parameter and the interface or path MTU, so that the
|segment size can be chosen so as to keep the each IP datagram below a
|target size."
|Maybe split it into two sentences:
|"TCP avoids fragmentation by segmenting data into packets that are smaller
|than or equal to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS). As for each transmitted
|segment the size of the IP and TCP headers is known, the IP packet size can
|be chosen to keep it below the other end's MSS and path MTU."

changed in -16 as proposed.

|3) In R8 you mention a timeout. Is it already anywhere specified how to set
|such a time for DNS retransmissions? If so, I think a reference would be
|useful. If not, more guidance is need to avoid network overload.

Added reference to RFC 8961 proposed by Martin Duke.

* Genart: Christer Holmberg

|Q1: R3 and R6 mentions the recommended size of 1400. I think it would be useful
|with a reference to Annex B, where this value is justified.

Added "(See Appendix A for details.)" in both R3 and R6.

|Nits/editorial comments: N/A

* Secdir: Donald Eastlake
|The summary of the review is Ready with Issues.
|
|Security
|--------
|
|In Section 7.3, the second paragraph on DNSSEC does not seem to belong in a
|section on "Weaknesses of IP fragmentation". I suggest moving it to a new
|Section 7.4 entitled "DNS Security Protections" or the like.

edited as proposed.

|Not only should the existing DNSSEC material be moved there but there should
|be some mention of transaction authentication. The existing document
|completely ignores RFC 8945 and RFC 2931 transaction authentication which, it
|seems to me, when used, overcome the security infirmities of fragmented UDP.
|Furthermore, transaction security protects delegation responses. Perhaps
|adding something like "DNS transaction security [RFC8945] [RFC2931] does
|protect against the security risks of fragmentation including protecting
|delegation responses. But [RFC8945] has limited applicability due to key
|distribution requirements and there is little if any deployment of [RFC2931]."

added this text in Introduction.

|There seem to be inconsistent implementation requirements for recommendation
|R7. R7 itself says "MAY" but Section 7.1 says "should" in such a way that I
|think it should be capitalized "SHOULD". Also, I think the last sentence of
|7.1 should be deleted and recommendation R2 made a "SHOULD".

R7 changed as "SHOULD" and removed "In the future, ...".

|Minor
|-----
|
|This draft has scattered statements in it that seem in need of qualification
|or rewording to be correct.
|
|Abstract: "Large DNS/UDP responses are fragmented" -> "Larger DNS/UDP messages
|are more likely to be fragmented" Couldn't a request have lots of Additional
|Information RRs and be large?

edited as proposed.q

|Section 1. Introduction:, last sentence of first paragraph: It isn't the DNS
|buffer size that causes fragmentation, it's caused by big packets. There may
|be applications where all the packets are not that large. There are lots of
|ways to fix this sentence, of which perhaps the simplest would be to add "In
|the general case" to the beginning of the sentence. Other possibilities are
|things like "DNS over UDP relies on IP fragmentation when a packet is larger
|than the path MTU, which is invited by an EDNS buffer size larger than the
|path MTU."

edited as the latter proposal.

|Section 1. Introduction, first sentence of 3rd paragraph top of page 3:
|summarized -> states

fixed

|Section 1. Introduction, last paragraph, page 3: First sentence is fine. I
|don't understand just what the rest of the paragraph is saying or why it is
|useful. A "path MTU" can be "obtained" (not set?) through "static
|configuration, server routing hints, ..."? Is this configuration/hint
|affecting transit devices so as to limit/expand the path MTU? What's going on
|here?

Changed the part as new paragraph, and changed "can be" as "might be".

|Section 3., first paragraph: So, down here we learn that private/local
|networks are out of scope. This limitation should be earlier, like in the
|Abstract and Introduction. I also suggest considering flipping it around and
|saying "This document is primarily applicable to DNS use on the global
|Internet."

Added this text in Introduction.
(However, texts in section 3 remains)

|R2: While a BCP certainly shouldn't say "MUST" for something that is
|"currently impossible", I don't see why it can't say "SHOULD" to push things
|in the right direction. "MAY" is pretty wimpy.

Robert Wilton's DISCUSS proposed another fix.

|R5 seems redundant with part of R3.

  merged R5 as "the network MTU value configured by the knowledge of the network operators,"

|The last sentence in Section 3.1, which is after R5, seems more applicable to
|R4 and should probably be moved up to between R4 and R5. Also, that sentence
|uses RFC 6891 as the reference for "the TC bit". But the TC bit has only one
|minor occurrence in RFC 6891. I believe RFC 1035Â is the appropriate reference.

  R5 removed. fixed the reference to "RFC 1035".

|Section 7.2 says "... fragmentation, which is universally considered to be
|harmful ..." I don't like "universally" as it might overpower the scope
|limitation to exclude private/local networks in some readers' minds and it is
|my understanding that within an over provisioned local network, fragmentation
|can be quite reliable and improve performance. How about "... fragmentation,
|which is considered harmful on the global Internet"?

  removed "universally"

|Appendix C: I think you should make up your mind and either tell the RFC
|Editor to remove this before publication or to retain it. I would definitely
|lean towards removal.

changed as : "Editor note: RFC Editor, please remove this entire section."

|Nits
|----
|
|R1: 'without "Fragment' -> 'without a "Fragment'

changed another way.

|R2: "OS" is used only once here in the explanation after the recommendation.
|Just spell it out.

changed as "many operating systems' kernels"

|R4: "in path MTU size" -> "in the path MTU size"

fixed

|Section 4: The first two recommendations do not end with a period although all
|other recommendations do end with a period.

  added periods.

|Section 5: I would add something right after the Section 5 header like "Some
|authoritative servers deviate from the DNS standard as follows:" and then make
|the current first two sentences in Section 5 indented and/or numbered or
|otherwise clearly a list.

  changed as proposed.

* Artart: Barry Leiba
| Thanks for addressing most comments from my earlier review.  One remains, and I
| didn't see an email response about it, so I don't know whether there was a
| reason not to make a change or if it just got overlooked:
| 
| " Section 7.2 "
| 
|    If a UDP response packet is dropped (for any reason), it increases
|    the attack window for poisoning the requestor's cache.
| 
| But Section 3.2 says this:
| 
|    R7.  UDP requestors MAY drop fragmented DNS/UDP responses without IP
|    reassembly to avoid cache poisoning attacks.
| 
| which seems to be contradictory.  Can you clarify this apparent contradiction
| in one place or both?

edited as Paul Vixie proposed.

* DISCUSS: Martin Duke
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| DISCUSS:
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
| 1) I'm unclear about Sec 4, R11 and Appendix B. When configured for minimal
| response, are responses to ALL requesters reduced in size, or only to those
| requesters that indicate a small MTU?

all responses reduced in size.
"minimal-responses" means that the response does not contain unnecessary data,
but contains everything necessary.

| As DNS becomes a more important vehicle for various discovery protocols (e.g.
| ECH), I would hate for responders to globally invoke a policy that makes it
| hard to deploy those protocols. But I'm happy to discuss this.

Even in a "minimal-response" environment, when you query an HTTPS/SVCB
record, a complete HTTPS/SVCB record is returned, so ECH is also
included.

| 2) In section 3.2, R8, please add RFC 8961 as a normative reference for how to
| set the timeout (e.g. "UDP requestors MUST observe [RFC8961] in setting their
| timeout.")

| 
| Thanks to Mirja Kuhlewind for the TSVART review, and to the authors for

| 
| (1) I support Rob's DISCUSS (and Paul's comment) about SHOULD/MAY. "do it

Robert Wilton's DISCUSS proposed another fix.

    R2. Where supported, UDP responders SHOULD set
    IP "Don't Fragment flag (DF) bit" [RFC0791] on IPv4.

| (2) Section 3.1, R1 says that responders SHOULD omit the fragment header. Under

| 
| I support Rob Wilton's DISCUSS position.  Piling on a bit, in reference to:
| 
|    R6.  UDP requestors SHOULD limit the requestor's maximum UDP payload
|    size to the RECOMMENDED size of 1400 or a smaller size.
| 
| I think the "RECOMMENDED" here is just carrying forward a "RECOMMENDED" from
| someplace else.  If that's correct, I suggest changing it to "recommended" or,
| if you want to be more precise, "... to the size recommended by RFCXXXX of 1400
| or smaller."  Now it's clear what the SHOULD is referencing, and you don't own
| the RECOMMENDED part here.

  changed as Robert Wilton's DISCUSS and "SHOULD".

| I suggest defining "EMSGSIZE" in Section 2 to be the UNIX error code of the
| same name.  Otherwise, we encounter it in Section 3.1 in a way that could mean
| it's an error code (which is how I think you intend it) or as a symbolic name

simply removed EMSGSIZE.

| 
| For what it's worth, and warning! this is a small thing, I think "zone operators" is a bit vague.
| 
| The presumed intent of the phrase given the recommendations in the document is to identify people responsible for the choice of records in a DNS zone as part of the target audience. However, in my experience
| 
| - "zone" has many meanings outside of the DNS
| - "zone" as a concept is poorly understood amongst people who fit the implied target audience but who are not protocol afficionados

| 
| Hi,
| 
| Thanks for this document.
| 
| I'm echoing Paul's and the SECDIR review comments here on the use of MAY in
| recommendations (since everywhere you see MAY it is equally valid for an
| interpretation to treat it as "MAY NOT"), but I think that this makes the
| document, as a proposed BCP, unclear enough that I'm raising this to level of a
| DISCUSS.
| 
| (1) p 3, sec 3.1.  Recommendations for UDP responders
| 
|    At the time of writing, most DNS server software did not set the DF
|    bit for IPv4, and many OS kernel constraints make it difficult to set
|    the DF bit in all cases.  Best Current Practice documents should not
|    specify what is currently impossible, so R2, which is setting the DF
|    bit, is "MAY" rather than "SHOULD".
| 
| I think that this recommendation, particularly because it is using RFC 2119
| language, is unclear.  I would suggest rephasing this to something like:
| 
|    R2.  Where supported, UDP responders SHOULD set IP "Don't Fragment
|    flag (DF) bit" [RFC0791] on IPv4.

Edited as proposed.

| (2) p 3, sec 3.2.  Recommendations for UDP requestors
| 
|    R6.  UDP requestors SHOULD limit the requestor's maximum UDP payload
|    size to the RECOMMENDED size of 1400 or a smaller size.
| 
| I find this recommendation to be unclear because it mixes both a "SHOULD" and
| "RECOMMENDED", i.e., I find it unclear as to what the "SHOULD" applies to.  Is
| the recommendation (i) that UDP requestors should limit the maximum UDP
| payload.  Or (ii) is the recommendation that a limit of 1400 be used, or (iii)
| perhaps both.  Maybe rewording this to something like the following would help:
| 
|    R6.  UDP requestors SHOULD limit the requestor's maximum UDP payload
|    size to 1400 bytes, but MAY limit the maximum UDP payload size to a
|    smaller size on small MTU (less than 1500 bytes) networks.
| 
|    or,
| 
|    R6.  UDP requestors SHOULD limit the requestor's maximum UDP payload
|    size.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a limit of 1400 bytes, but a smaller
|    limit MAY be used.

edited as proposed, and changed "RECOMMENDED" as "SHOULD".

| (3) p 3, sec 3.2.  Recommendations for UDP requestors
| 
|    R7.  UDP requestors MAY drop fragmented DNS/UDP responses without IP
|    reassembly to avoid cache poisoning attacks.
| 
| As written, I don't think that this is really a recommendation.  Either it is a
| just a statement or fact (in which case it is not a recommendation), or it
| should be upgraded to a SHOULD.

changed as "SHOULD"

| (4) p 4, sec 3.2.  Recommendations for UDP requestors
| 
|    R7.  UDP requestors MAY drop fragmented DNS/UDP responses without IP
|    reassembly to avoid cache poisoning attacks.



|    R8.  DNS responses may be dropped by IP fragmentation.  Upon a
|    timeout, to avoid resolution failures, UDP requestors MAY retry using
|    TCP or UDP with a smaller EDNS requestor's maximum UDP payload size
|    per local policy.
| 
| Again, I think that this document would be clearer if this was a SHOULD rather
| than a MAY.

Since all implementations do some kind of retries,
the details are left to the implementer,
so I think we can change "MAY" to "SHOULD".

| 
| Thank you for this document, DNS is so important for the global Internet that a
| BCP is welcome. I am afraid that for several reasons I was unable to review
| correctly this document on time, mainly relying on VladimÃ­r ÄunÃ¡t's DNS-dir
| review at
| https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-dnsop-avoid-fragmentation-16-dnsdir-telechat-cunat-2023-12-27/
| .
| 
| Nevertheless, I support Rob's DISCUSS about the use of MAY/SHOULD about the
| IPv4 DF-bit in section 3.1; also, an assertion like `many OS kernel constraints
| make it difficult to set the DF bit` should be backed by a reference.
| 
| I also find 'light' to rely on TCP MSS as it is set by the end points only,
| i.e., it can also leads to IPv4 fragmentation in the path (or IPv6
| fragmentation by the kernel at the source).

Agree. But, DNS/UDP communications happen without TCP.

| Section 3, does `These recommendations are intended for nodes with global IP
| addresses on the Internet` also cover the use of NAT/NPT when the requestor
| uses RFC 1918 addresses or ULA?

The global IP address after NAT/NPT is already the target of this document.

| In section 3.1:
| 
| - R1 why not simply stating that there should be no IPv6 fragmentation ? Atomic
| fragments are now discouraged for IPv6

  R1 is changed as "R1. UDP responders SHOULD NOT use IPv6 fragmentation {{!RFC8200}}."

| - R3 where is the packet size of 1400 coming from ? Some reasoning would be
| welcome (e.g., based on some measurements over the global Internet). Put at
| least a forward reference to the appendix.
| 
| In section 4, R9: where is `13 may be too large` coming from ?

Removed '(13 may be too large)'.

| 
| Appendix `the authors' recommendation` is it a recommendation by the authors or
| by the IETF in an IETF stream document?

|```
|     This document specifies various techniques to avoid IP fragmentation
|          of UDP packets in DNS.
|	  ```
|	  Really wish that this BCP made a much stronger recommendation for DNS over TCP.

added "[RFC7766] states that all general-purpose DNS
implementations MUST support both UDP and TCP transport." in Introduction.

|### Section 3.1, paragraph 0
|```
|  3.1.  Recommendations for UDP responders
|  ```
|  I find myself agreeing with other ballots on these recommendations.
|  Will refrain from duplicating them (and also from holding another DISCUSS
|  based on them.)
|
|### Section 3.1, paragraph 3
|```
| At the time of writing, most DNS server software did not set the DF
| bit for IPv4, and many OS kernel constraints make it difficult to set
| the DF bit in all cases.  Best Current Practice documents should not
| specify what is currently impossible, so R2, which is setting the DF
| bit, is "MAY" rather than "SHOULD".
| ```
| Maybe I'm familiar with different kernels, but all the ones I am
| familiar with (except for some IoT platforms) readily offer socket
| options to set DF (and prevent stack fragmentation in v6).

Agree. However, DNS software deveoppers cannot set DF bit "in all cases".

Robert Wilton's DISCUSS proposed another fix.

    R2. Where supported, UDP responders SHOULD set
    IP "Don't Fragment flag (DF) bit" [RFC0791] on IPv4.

|### Section 3.1, paragraph 3
|```
| R3.  UDP responders SHOULD compose response packets that fit in the
| minimum of the offered requestor's maximum UDP payload size
| [RFC6891], the interface MTU, and the RECOMMENDED maximum DNS/UDP
| payload size 1400.
| ```
| Why SHOULD, i.e., when would it ever be OK to do this? Also, where
| does the 1400 byte value come from (magic constant?)

Please see Appendix A (added reference to Appendix A)

|### Section 3.1, paragraph 3
|```
| R5.  UDP responders SHOULD limit the response size when UDP
| responders are located on small MTU (<1500) networks.
| ```
|  Limit *to what*?

  merged R3 and R5 and changed as
  "the network MTU value configured by the knowledge of the network operators,"

|### Section 4, paragraph 0
|```
|  4.  Recommendations for zone operators and DNS server operators
|  ```
|  I find it somewhat questionable to recommend changes in how DNS is
|  being operated just to cater to UDP needing to remain a viable
|  transport. (I realize I may be an outlier here.)

It is true, even when we need to use PQC signatures.
